Walmart Sales Performance Analysis – End-to-End BI Project

Tools Used: Excel, Power Query, Power BI
Type: Data Cleaning, Transformation, Visualization & Business Insights

1. Project Overview

This project provides a complete analytical workflow using Walmart supermarket sales data. Starting from a raw Excel dataset, the information was thoroughly cleaned, transformed, and organized to build an interactive Power BI dashboard.
The objective of the project was to evaluate overall sales performance, analyze product-line profitability, understand customer behavior, and study trends across different branches and cities.
The final dashboard enables quick and impactful decision-making by highlighting what drives revenue, which product lines underperform, and how customer preferences change across months and branches.

2. Data Preparation and Cleaning (Excel / Power Query)

Initial Assessment

The raw dataset (WalmartSalesData.xlsx) contained transaction-level information such as:
	•	Invoice ID
	•	Branch and City
	•	Product Line
	•	Unit Price, Quantity, Tax, Total
	•	Customer Type
	•	Payment Method
	•	Customer Ratings
	•	Date and Time of purchase

Data Cleaning Steps
	•	Removed duplicate rows to ensure unique transactions.
	•	Standardized data types for all fields (numeric, text, date, time).
	•	Corrected inconsistent category names.
	•	Ensured no invalid numerical values (e.g., negative quantities or prices).

3. Power BI Modeling and Dashboard Development

Dashboard Goals

The intention of the dashboard was to answer key business questions such as:
	•	Which product lines bring the highest revenue and income?
	•	Which branches perform better in terms of total sales?
	•	How do customer types and payment modes vary across transactions?
	•	Is there any seasonal pattern visible across months?
	•	What is the overall customer satisfaction level?

Visuals Included in the Dashboard
	•	Gross Income by Product Line
	•	Total Sales by Branch
	•	Total Sales by Product Line
	•	Monthly and City-wise Sales Trend
	•	Payment Method Distribution
	•	Customer Type Segmentation (Member vs Normal)
	•	KPI Cards (Total Sales After Tax, Profit, Quantity Sold, Average Rating)

4. Key Insights from the Dashboard

4.1 Product Line Performance

Food and Beverages, Sports and Travel, and Electronic Accessories generate the highest overall revenue and gross income.
Health and Beauty consistently performs the lowest and may require promotional strategies to improve sales.

4.2 Branch-Level Sales

Branch C records the highest total sales (111K), while Branches A and B follow with 106K each. The performance is relatively stable across all three branches.

4.3 Monthly Sales Trend

Sales show a noticeable decline in February across all cities, followed by a sharp recovery in March. Mandalay displays the strongest growth from February to March.

4.4 Payment Method Analysis

Customer payments are almost evenly split between digital and cash methods:
	•	E-Wallet: 34.5%
	•	Cash: 34.4%
	•	Credit Card: 31.1%

Digital payments (E-Wallet + Credit Card) make up nearly 70% of all transactions.

4.5 Customer Type Insights

The customer base is equally divided:
	•	Members: 50.1%
	•	Normal Customers: 49.9%

This indicates a well-balanced customer mix and good engagement with the membership program.

4.6 Overall KPIs
	•	Total Quantity Sold: 920
	•	Total Sales After Tax: 55.12K
	•	Profit per Quantity: 473.04
	•	Average Customer Rating: 7.01

These metrics provide a clear performance summary for decision-making.

5. Business Recommendations
	1.	Increase marketing efforts and inventory for high-performing categories such as Food and Beverages, Sports and Travel, and Electronic Accessories.
	2.	Improve the performance of weaker product lines like Health and Beauty through bundle offers or targeted promotions.
	3.	Strengthen partnerships with digital payment providers since most customers prefer e-wallet and card payments.
	4.	Investigate the February sales drop to identify external or internal factors and stabilize monthly revenue.
	5.	Enhance customer experience to improve the average customer rating beyond 7.01 through faster service, better product availability, and staff training.

6. Final Deliverables
	•	Cleaned and structured Excel dataset ready for analysis
	•	Fully interactive Power BI dashboard featuring:
	•	Branch and product-line comparisons
	•	Payment method distribution
	•	Monthly sales trends
	•	Customer segmentation
	•	KPI metrics

The dashboard effectively presents both high-level and detailed insights into Walmart’s operations.
